## tom_party [Placeholder Name]

This is an experimental project of mine. The idea is to create a party-game similar to Jackbox.

The server will be written in Rust, using Reddis as the in-memory database for it, while the game will be programmed using GDScript in the Godot engine (Probably).

### Requirements:

This needs:
 - Rust, including all dependencies in the cargo file
 - Redis
 - Godot (soonâ„¢)
