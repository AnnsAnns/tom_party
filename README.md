## tom_party [Placeholder Name]

This is an experimental project of mine. The idea is to create a party-game similar to Jackbox.

The server will be written in Rust, using Reddis as the in-memory database for it, while the game will be programmed using GDScript in the Godot engine.

### Requirements:

This needs:
 - Rust, including all dependencies in the cargo file
 - Redis
 - Godot

### Structure:

This server, written in Rust using Rocket, is located within the ```src``` folder. The folder and file structure relates to the API structure ([See: Backend API](https://github.com/tumGER/tom_party#backend-api)).

The Godot client, written in GDScript, is located within the ```src_godot``` folder. It follows the standard Godot structure of ```Scenes``` and ```Scripts``` with subfolders relating to their usage, such as ```Functions```, ```AutoLoad``` or ```UI```.

The redis DB follows the standard config and works out of the box.
